  <p class='paragraphtext'>As a student body from Okinawa, the island that has faced the Battle of Okinawa, we strongly believe that Article 9 should not be amended in order to prevent anything to happen that may repeat history. Not only the Battle of Okinawa, where more than a hundred thousand of our beloved ancestors died miserably in middle of confusion,<sup>[1]</sup> Japan is also the only country that has faced the horrifying effect of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which are still present in many civilians. Due to such history, majority of the citizens of Japan are against the amendment under the current government<sup>[2]</sup> because we know how one’s life becomes a mere tool for competition for power. We hold the belief that Japan must remain a country to symbolize the country of peace without war—we must have our voices heard, that such a world is possible through the presence of the Article 9. 
<br><br>Regarding the Self Defense Force, there are people that are serving the country with their pride, not whether they are justified on the paper or not, but by their respect and love for the country <sup>[3]</sup>. Moreover, if the Article 9 is amended, we are afraid of the potential changes on the other articles as well. Amending an article must be done in the most careful way with the agreement of its citizens. If not, we believe that the people must stand firm to not let that happen. Although some people argue that we must amend Article 9 to serve the world, we strongly believe that by suspending the right to go to war, it acts as a sign of protest against war, serving greater value to the world. 
<br><br>We believe that as of now, taking action would be a difficult challenge. Since public opinion is almost equally divided up in three opinions, it would be illogical to accept one opinion, because that would mean that the other two opinions would be completely disregarded. We instead believe that we should raise awareness of this issue to the Japanese public and make discussions easier and stress-free. According to a statistic, a third of Japanese citizens cannot make up their mind as to whether amendment is acceptable or not <sup>[4]</sup>. What we can do is to raise awareness about the issue and let the neutral body make up their mind, which will allow the issue to be divided into at least two parties. Secondly, Japanese people tend to indirectly express their opinions, fearing prejudice or negative impressions about them. What we can do is to lessen such barriers and let discussions flourish among all citizens, without any fear. We believe that by letting our true opinions out, we can overall come to a better conclusion.
